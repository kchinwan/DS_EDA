Use Case: Helpdesk Automation for Stuck Transactions in Integration Platform
>>Background
This project involves integrating over 4000 applications using platforms like MuleSoft and another integration tool.
These platforms act as middleware, enabling communication between different end-user applications.

>>Current Problem
Sometimes, transactions get stuck or fail during integration.
When this happens, users raise issues with the support analysts.
  
The analysts manually:
1. Check Splunk logs
2. Review application logs
3. Refer to documentation/mappings
4. Then explain the cause of the failure

  >>Goal
The team wants to automate this support process using a helpdesk assistant (like a chatbot or tool).
This system should help analysts (or even users) quickly understand the reason for stuck transactions by:
Reading and understanding logs (Splunk + app logs)
Mapping errors or codes using documentation
Providing a clear explanation or root cause
